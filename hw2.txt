What command did you use to configure the remote?
git remote add origin https://github.com/Yinglai/HW2-partC.git

Instead of creating a new git repository and configuring it with this remote, I could have asked you to git clone the repo from afs. If you had done so, what would the output of git remote -v be?
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Yinglai/afs.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Yinglai/afs.git (push)

It will show the remote information


Run git fetch remotename (substituting your remote name for remotename).
Did anything appear in your working directory? Why?
Nothing appeared in my working directory, because the content of the fetch is in the .git folder.


Update your local master branch with the remote one, and give the command you used to do so.
